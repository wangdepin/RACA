## Agent Deck

Run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel. Essential for:
- Installing packages on multiple clusters simultaneously
- Running experiments while doing other work
- Managing long-running jobs in background sessions

**Install (from terminal):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or use the helper script (also creates a session):
```bash
bash tools/setup-agent-deck.sh
```

**Start Agent Deck:**
```bash
agent-deck
```

This opens a session manager. Create sessions, each runs its own Claude Code instance.

**Essential keybindings:**
- `Ctrl+Q` — back to main window (session keeps running)
- `q` / `Ctrl+C` — exit Agent Deck to terminal
- `Enter` / arrow keys — select and enter a session
- `n` — create new session
- `?` — show all keybindings

**Note:** Exit your current Claude Code session first, then launch `agent-deck` which manages Claude sessions for you.
